This is the code to accompany my co-first author paper (with Harin Lee), "Single and mixture prenatal per- and polyfluoroalkyl subsstances and total folate levels in pregnant women in the Health Outcomes and Measures if the Environment (HOME) Study" 

This repository contains the following:

1. An R markdown file with the original code and annotations.
2. An html file of the R markdown file.

This study used data from the Health Outcomes and Measured of the Environment (HOME) Study. This data is not publically available; however, data can be requested here: https://homestudy.research.cchmc.org/contact
